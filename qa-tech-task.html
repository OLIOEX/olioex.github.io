        <h3>QA Coding Task</h3>
<p>Hello,</p>

<p>Welcome to OLIO's technical task for QAs. For this we'd like to you test a few public endpoints of the [Github REST API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest) and the Github UI</p>

<p>We have three things that we'd like you to test:</p>
<ol>
  <li>View the OLIOEX organisation's public github repositories, specifically we'd like you to test that:
    <ul>
      <li>`proximityhash` repository exists</li> 
      <li>what licence it uses</li>
      <li>how many stars the repository has</li>
    </ul>
  </li>  
  <li>Test that you are able to view the latest list of commits for that repository</li>
  <li>Fetch the latest commiter and check that their name and avatar match expectations</li>
</li>

<p>As this position is has a manual and an automated aspect we'd like you to deliver these as both a set of manual test scenarios and an automated test suite. We're leaving this deliberately vague to see what and how is appropriate to test. Please deliver the results of your efforts in the way you feel is best.</p>

<p>Once you are done please email lloyd@olioex.com with the code, or a link to the code. After this we'll arrange a follow up technical interview to discuss what you submitted. Also if you haven't previously used the app it would be a good idea to have given it a go before your interview (bonus points for organising a collection ðŸ˜€).</p>

<p>If you have any questions please feel free to email myself at any time.</p>

<p>Cheers, Lloyd.</p>
